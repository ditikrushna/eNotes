Hi there ! Nice to e-meet you.

My Name is Ditikrushna Giri peeps call me Diti . Oh yeah,You are supposed to call me Diti as well anyway if you have a better name for me please do let me know and i am soon to be 23 years of age which won't be for long and you may get intresting that i have the soul of a teenager . I like deep talks ,thinking and exploring life through meeting  new people and exchangeing ideas with peoples. **We can't be friends if you are not a dreamer or a believer of bigger things**. My favorite things to talk apart from Technology about are God , religion , life ,human psychology and why the things are the way they are .I am extermly passionate about learning new things.Ignorance and stupidity awaken the murderous dargon inside me .However,most people find me obnoxious. I am definitely kind and empathetic but it's more harmful than helpful . Other peoples hurt bcomes my own and it sucks .People deserve to feel their pain without feeling like they are dragging me down with them so I have to pretend I'm not hurting as much as i am when I see someone in pain. 
At the end I would love to mention my email id to cordially invite your suggestions and have conversation with new you. **ditikrushna.nitt@gmail.com**
