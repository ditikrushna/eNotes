#### Week1 :[Introduction] [PPT](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/phoenixassets/ml-foundations/intro.pdf)

The Machine Learning Pipeline 

> Data -> ML Method -> Intelligence 

**Case Study Approach** 
Use various ML Methods in different case studies :
1. Regression Case Study 1: Predicting House Prices
2. Classifcation Case Study 2: Sentiment Analysis
3. Clustering Case Study 3: Document Retrieval
4. Matrix Factorization Case Study 4: Product Recommendation
5. Deep Learning Cases Study 5: Visual Product Recommender
