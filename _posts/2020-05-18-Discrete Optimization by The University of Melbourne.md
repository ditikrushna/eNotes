### Week 1 : 

**Practial Implementation Tip:**
 - **DFS Branch and Bound**
	- It pays off quite well to sort the inputs by either value, weight, or value/weight 
     - **Investigate:** The optimum stratergy should be to check the entropy of the field and choose the one with lowest 
  - **Dynamic Programming**
	  - It could be speeded up by using sparse tables to represent 	transition points
       - The pseudo-polynomial time concept can be understood by constructing a DP table for non-integral weight values ;)
